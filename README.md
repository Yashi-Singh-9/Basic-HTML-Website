This project is part of the [roadmap.sh](https://roadmap.sh/projects/basic-html-website) frontend developer roadmap.

The site is a portfolio layout with proper sections like header, footer, navigation, and main content, but without styling beyond essential layout.

## Features
- Structured using semantic HTML elements.
- Includes sections like header, footer, navigation, and main content.
- Displays portfolio information such as projects, work experience, and reviews.
- Organized into multiple columns for different content types (projects, work experience, education, etc.).
